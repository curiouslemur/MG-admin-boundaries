# MG-admin-boundaries
Shapefiles of Madagascar administrative boundaries level 0 to 4. The labeling of the levels are my own, made for "clean-code" purposes only. 
** In 2007 the, the admin level "provinces" has been dissolved. 

Therefore, the labeling here might not be the same as the official labeling, if any. 

* level 0: country
* level 1: provinces
* level 2: regions
* level 3: districts / departments
* level 4: communes
* level 5: Fokontany
